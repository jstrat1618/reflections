What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git is now able to track the files in the repository. So you can track the files in case you need to reference an old version. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
		The staging area is like the mail room, where you can organize your files for clearer, logical commits, like a mail room may sort mail that's going to the same location.
